# Advent of Code 2016

Here's my repository for the puzzles available at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).  
I'll try to solve/publish solutions every day, as the puzzles become available, but there might come a day (*) when I have no time for solving the puzzles and/or don't have a clue how to solve them :)

(*) Looking at you, [Dec 11](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/11)! Currently trying to catch-up with the tasks.

**Comments, suggestions and critiques are welcome.**
